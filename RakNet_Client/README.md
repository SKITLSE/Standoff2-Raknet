# How to use it
In order to use The raknet network engine in your project, I recommend that you study the test client and server.
See SampleClient.cs and SampleServer.cs

# What's new?
- Updated and optimized native (C++) code
- Added: Bitstream ( ***Write/read data with a simple and reliable tool, supports compression, delta compression*** )
- Added: Password for the server ( ***Restrict connections to the server with a password*** )
- Added: Data encryption ( ***Strong data encryption, you don't need to worry about connection security... You can disable it if you decide to use your own encryption*** )
- Added: Setting bandwidth limit ( ***Bandwidth limit for each connection***)
- Added: Getting specific statistics data ( ***Getting the amount of data sent/received, transfer rate, ping, loss, etc.*** )
- Added: Query Features ( ***Request server data using the UDP protocol used in any programming languages that support it*** )
- Added: Anti-DDos ( ***Restriction of connection from same address for some time*** )

# Creating own client & server
> To create your own server, check out the examples [here](https://github.com/ep1s0de3/RakNet_Networking/blob/main/Assets/RakNet/Samples/SampleClient.cs) and [here](https://github.com/ep1s0de3/RakNet_Networking/blob/main/Assets/RakNet/Samples/SampleServer.cs)

# Query
## Quering data from server
>To request information about the server, you need to send a packet to the server with an 8-byte header, taking any representation of the header from the table below

| string | ulong | hex |
|----:|:----:|:----------|
| `RakQuery` | `8751168580485865810` | `0x79726575516B6152` |

>See [Query Sample](https://github.com/ep1s0de3/RakNet_Networking/blob/main/Assets/RakNet/Samples/RakQuerySample.cs)

>If the server-side response data is not specified, the server responded with the text message "RakQuery"

>If the server does not respond to requests, then the server is turned off, or the port on which it is running is closed, or the acceptance of requests is disabled by the user

## Set Query Responce on server-side
> To specify the data for the response call RakServer.SetQueryResponce(byte[] data) (***It is recommended to call at intervals of 2-3 seconds***)

> To disable query processing, call RakServer.AllowQuery(false);

# Attention!
### This version of the network engine is not compatible with others!
### After each update release, I strongly recommend replacing the libraries from the Plugins folder and all scripts to avoid connection errors and crashes.
